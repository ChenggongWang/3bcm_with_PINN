# 3bcm_with_PINN
Use Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to 
- fit the 3-box climate model (3bcm)
- learn climate parameters (e.g. climate feedbacks, ocean heat uptake rate and efficacy)
- predict outside the data range.

#Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN)
To use PINN learns (fits) the data and the physical model in the same time, we need to construct the loss function not only with traditional data loss, but also the function loss. So, the trained NN satisfies the data and the physics in the same time.
